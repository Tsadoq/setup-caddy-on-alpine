Caddy LAN Reverse Proxy (Alpine/OpenRC)

Single-command setup for a home LAN reverse proxy on Alpine Linux (OpenRC) using Caddy with its internal CA (no public ACME, no Namecheap).
It installs Caddy, creates a clean per-vhost layout, adds caddy-add / caddy-del helpers, prints AdGuard DNS rewrites, and survives reboots.

✨ What you get
	•	Caddy running on Alpine with OpenRC (enabled at boot).
	•	Internal TLS (Caddy’s local CA) for home.<domain> and *.home.<domain>.
	•	Per-vhost Caddyfiles in /etc/caddy/sites/*.caddy + a shared snippet (lan-common).
	•	Helpers:
	•	caddy-add <host> <ip> [port] [path_prefix]
	•	caddy-del <host>
	•	Proper bind caps (cap_net_bind_service) so no root ports hackery.
	•	A copy of the CA root at /root/caddy-internal-ca-root.crt (easy to distribute).
	•	Idempotent: safe to re-run; optional purge of old installs.

⸻

⚠️ Read this first
	•	Designed for Alpine Linux (e.g., an LXC or VM). Uses apk + OpenRC.
	•	Intended for LAN use. Browsers will warn until you trust the CA on your devices.
	•	You’ll need AdGuard Home (or equivalent) to point DNS at the proxy.
	•	The script writes/overwrites:
	•	/etc/caddy/Caddyfile, /etc/caddy/sites/, /etc/conf.d/caddy
	•	ensures /var/lib/caddy & /var/log/caddy exist
	•	Re-run friendly. If Caddy is already present, it will ask to purge (or honor PURGE=1/0).

⸻

✅ Requirements
	•	Alpine Linux (root or sudo).
	•	Network where AdGuard Home can serve your clients’ DNS.
	•	The script installs needed packages automatically: caddy libcap iproute2 curl ca-certificates coreutils.

🚀 Quick start

Run with your domain/email (defaults shown):

curl -fsSL https://YOUR.URL/caddy-setup.sh \
| sudo sh -s -- DOMAIN=cordele.xyz HOME_LABEL=home ADMIN_EMAIL=you@cordele.xyz

Non-interactive purge of any prior install:

curl -fsSL https://YOUR.URL/caddy-setup.sh \
| sudo PURGE=1 sh -s -- DOMAIN=cordele.xyz HOME_LABEL=home ADMIN_EMAIL=you@cordele.xyz

After it finishes, add two AdGuard DNS rewrites pointing to your LXC IP:

home.cordele.xyz     → A → 192.168.1.51
*.home.cordele.xyz   → A → 192.168.1.51

Then add your first host:

caddy-add adguard.home.cordele.xyz 192.168.1.19 80

Test (from a client that uses AdGuard DNS):

curl -I https://home.cordele.xyz
curl -I https://adguard.home.cordele.xyz

🛠 What the script does
	•	Installs Caddy (apk) and grants cap_net_bind_service.
	•	Writes a Caddyfile with a shared (lan-common) snippet (internal CA, compression, headers), a minimal base host for home.<domain>, and import /etc/caddy/sites/*.caddy.
	•	Drops helpers caddy-add / caddy-del for vhost lifecycle.
	•	Configures OpenRC to run Caddy with /etc/caddy/Caddyfile, enables on boot, restarts.
	•	Triggers first cert issuance (loopback) and copies CA to /root/caddy-internal-ca-root.crt.
	•	Prints AdGuard rewrite instructions.

⸻

🔐 Security model
	•	TLS is issued by Caddy’s internal CA (LAN-trusted once you install the CA on your devices).
	•	No public exposure or DNS-01 needed.
	•	No auth by default; add Caddy middlewares (basic auth/OIDC) per host if desired.
	•	Port binding via capabilities, not root.

⸻

🌐 Network & DNS
	•	Use AdGuard Home → Filters → DNS rewrites:
	•	home.<domain> → A → <CADDY_LXC_IP>
	•	*.home.<domain> → A → <CADDY_LXC_IP>
	•	Add AAAA if your LAN uses IPv6 and the LXC has one.
	•	Ensure clients actually use AdGuard as their DNS (via DHCP).

➕ Add / remove hosts

Add:

# bare host → reverse proxy to IP:PORT
caddy-add grafana.home.cordele.xyz 192.168.1.20 3000

# app behind a path prefix (strips /gitea before proxy)
caddy-add gitea.home.cordele.xyz 192.168.1.42 3000 /gitea

Remove:

caddy-del grafana.home.cordele.xyz

Each host becomes a self-contained vhost file at /etc/caddy/sites/<host>.caddy, and the script validates config before reload.

⸻

🧾 Trust the internal CA

The CA root is placed at /root/caddy-internal-ca-root.crt on the server.

Install it on your devices:
	•	macOS: Keychain Access → System → Certificates → Import → set Always Trust.
	•	iOS/iPadOS: AirDrop/email file → install profile → Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings → enable.
	•	Windows: certmgr.msc → Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Certificates → Import.
	•	Android: Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → CA certificate.

⸻

🔍 Verify & manage

# Validate whole config
caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

# Reload service (OpenRC)
rc-service caddy reload   # or: rc-service caddy restart

# Check listening sockets
ss -lntp | grep -E ':80|:443' || netstat -lnt | grep -E ':80|:443'


⸻

🧯 Troubleshooting
	•	Browser warns about cert → Install the CA root on that device.
	•	404 for a hostname → Did you caddy-add that host? Is the backend IP/port reachable from the LXC?
	•	Name resolves to wrong IP → Confirm AdGuard rewrites; make sure the client uses AdGuard DNS.
	•	Caddy fails to start → caddy validate for syntax; check /etc/conf.d/caddy; try rc-service caddy restart.
	•	Binding errors → The script sets capabilities, but if you replaced the binary, re-run setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/caddy.

❓ FAQ

Is this Alpine-only?
Yes—this script targets Alpine + OpenRC. Ask if you want a cross-distro version (systemd, apt/dnf).

Can I bypass Caddy for a host?
Sure—add an exact DNS rewrite in AdGuard for that hostname pointing directly to the service IP. You’ll lose Caddy’s TLS/middlewares for that host.

Where are files?
Main: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
Vhosts: /etc/caddy/sites/*.caddy
Helpers: /usr/local/bin/caddy-{add,del}
CA copy: /root/caddy-internal-ca-root.crt
